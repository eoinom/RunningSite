<p>
In the days before your marathon, you're most likely going to be nervous and anxious, so you start packing early, especially if the marathon is out of town. Get all your shopping (for gels, food, etc) 
done several days before you leave, so you're not rushing around the day before the race.

Follow this marathon packing list to make sure you don't forget something important, like your running shoes.

Essential Items (In Your Carry-On Bag If You're Flying)
Running shoes
Running socks
Prescription medications
Medical insurance card
Identification (passport if the marathon is out of the country)
Race entry confirmation (if necessary)
Travel itinerary with confirmations and directions
Possible Clothing Items
Check the weather prediction to see what kind of conditions to expect. But don't assume that the weather forecast is correct — you should be prepared for weather that's 20 degrees F warmer and 
20 degrees F colder than the predicted temperature.

Possible Food Items
You'll want to pack foods that you've already experimented with before and during your training runs. Remember the golden rule of racing: Nothing new on race day!  
Don't assume that you'll be able to buy specific energy gels, bars, or other food at the race expo. It's better to buy them ahead of time and pack them, so you're guaranteed to have the foods 
that you like and you've trained with in the past.

Bottled water
Race fuels (energy bars, gels, sport beans, or other foods that you've been training with)
Snacks/breakfast foods (e.g., bagels, pretzels, muffins, fruit, etc.) If you're flying, be sure to put some snacks in your carry-on bag so you can snack on the plane.
Sports drinks
Salt packets or tablets (if you used them in training)
