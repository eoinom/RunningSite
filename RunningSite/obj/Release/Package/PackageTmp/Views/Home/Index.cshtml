        <h1>Welcome to the Dingle Running Festival</h1>
        <p>
            Situated on the spectacular Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland, this festival is surely one of the most scenic running festivals of its kind in the world.
            Dingle town comes alive during the festival with an incredible atmosphere and good times guaranteed all weekend. The Dingle Running Festival is not just a running event; it is the experience of a lifetime.
            Many seasoned international runners have described the Dingle Marathon as simply the best that they have experienced in the entire world.
            The unique “Dingle vibe” is very difficult for us to explain but once you’ve experienced it you’ll never forget it!
            There are amazing local sightseeing attractions like ‘Dingle Peninsula’, ‘Dingle Bay’, "Slea Head" and 'Dunmore Head'.

                <h3>Wexford Half Marathon or 10km</h3>
                <p>
                    The Wexford Half Marathon has proven itself over the years as Ireland’s record breaking course.
                    In 2012 a Guinness world record was broken in retro running! Individually people have consistently gotten PB’s.
                    Our Half marathon also has pacers catering for 1.30 / 1.45 / 2hrs to help you achieve your target time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last year 1,900 people enjoyed the scenic and fast course around Wexford town.
                    Wexford has proven itself a must do race for quality, friendliness and atmosphere.
                    Parking is easy and the course has plenty of variety starting in the town and taking you around surrounding countryside.
                    This year there'll be a new medal with a subtle bottle opener awaiting you at the very atmospheric finish line. Finish on a high note in Wexford!

                <p>
                    The Half on the Head follows a wonderfully scenic course from Ballyheigue Village right around Kerryhead (one of the closest places to the USA).

                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon rounding the point of Kerryhead you will experience the magnificent panorama of Tralee Bay with Mount Brandon and the Maherees as a backdrop.
                    Further along you have stunning views of the coastline stretching from Ballyheigue beach to Banna and Fenit with Blennerville Windmill in the distance.
                </p>
